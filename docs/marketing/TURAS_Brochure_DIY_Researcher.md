# Get More From Your Survey Data

## You've Got Questions. Your Data Has Answers.

You've collected survey responses. Maybe 100, maybe 1,000. You can see the percentages, but you're wondering:

- **"Which factors actually drive satisfaction?"**
- **"What features should I prioritize?"**
- **"What's the right price point?"**
- **"Are there different customer groups I should know about?"**

**TURAS gives you the answers—without needing a statistics degree.**

## What TURAS Can Do For You

### Find Out What Really Matters
**"Which of these 15 factors actually drives customer loyalty?"**

Your survey asked about product quality, price, service, delivery, etc. TURAS identifies which ones truly impact the outcomes you care about—and which ones don't actually matter much.

**You get:** A ranked list showing what to focus on first.

---

### Discover Hidden Customer Groups
**"Do I have different types of customers?"**

Maybe some customers care about price, others about service, and others about brand. TURAS finds these natural groups in your data.

**You get:** Customer profiles showing who they are, what they want, and how to reach them.

---

### Optimize Your Product Features
**"Which features should I include in my next release?"**

You have 20 potential features but can only build 5. TURAS shows you which combinations customers value most—and what they're willing to pay for them.

**You get:** Clear priorities backed by customer preferences, not guesswork.

---

### Find the Right Price
**"What should I charge?"**

Too low = leaving money on the table. Too high = losing customers. TURAS analyzes price sensitivity to find your optimal price point.

**You get:** The price range that maximizes revenue while maintaining demand.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: "I don't have a statistics background. Will I understand the results?"**
A: Yes. That's the point. We explain everything in plain English during the debrief. If you don't understand something, we'll explain it differently.

**Q: "How do I know which analysis method I need?"**
A: Tell us your business question. We'll recommend the right approach. Free consultation included.

**Q: "Can you work with data from [Survey Platform]?"**
A: Probably yes. We work with exports from Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, Alchemer, and most other platforms. Send us a sample file.

**Q: "What if my sample size is too small?"**
A: We'll tell you upfront if the analysis won't be reliable. We'd rather say no than deliver questionable results.

**Q: "Do I need to know R or statistics?"**
A: No. We handle all the technical work. You just need to understand your business question.

A: Yes. We offer questionnaire design review ($500-$1,500) to ensure your survey collects data that can answer your questions. Much cheaper than running a survey twice.
