---

## Margin Analysis

### Target Margins

| Service Category | Target Gross Margin |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Crosstabs | 70-75% |
| Weighting | 70-75% |
| Key Drivers | 65-70% |
| Segmentation | 60-65% |
| MaxDiff/Conjoint | 55-65% |
| Pricing | 65-70% |
| Tracker | 70-75% (after setup) |

### Cost Components (Per Project)

**Direct costs:**
- Analyst time (your primary cost)
- QA/review time (10-15% of analyst time)
- Output preparation/formatting

**Overhead allocation:**
- Infrastructure (minimal—R runs locally)
- Administrative time
- Business development amortization

### Break-Even Analysis

Assuming fully-loaded analyst cost of $50-75/hour:

| Service | Price | Estimated Hours | Gross Profit |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Simple crosstabs | $600 | 2-3 hrs | $375-450 |
| Standard crosstabs | $1,000 | 4-5 hrs | $625-750 |
| Weighting | $500 | 2-3 hrs | $300-375 |
| Key Driver | $2,000 | 6-8 hrs | $1,400-1,550 |
| Segmentation (full) | $5,500 | 16-20 hrs | $4,000-4,500 |
| MaxDiff (aggregate) | $2,800 | 8-10 hrs | $2,050-2,300 |
| MaxDiff (HB) | $5,500 | 14-18 hrs | $4,150-4,450 |

**Key insight:** High-touch services (segmentation, MaxDiff HB) have lower percentage margins but higher absolute profit per project. Crosstabs have highest margins but lower per-project profit—volume matters.

## Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### Anchoring

Always present prices in context:
- "Our standard crosstabs are $1,000—compared to $1,500-2,000 at traditional agencies"
- "Full segmentation project at $5,500 includes exploration, final solution, and profiling—typically $8,000+ elsewhere"

### Bundling

Create packages that increase average order value:

**"Survey Essentials" Bundle:** $2,200 (save $300)
- Standard crosstabs
- Weighting
- Confidence intervals

**"Driver Analysis Complete" Bundle:** $4,500 (save $500)
- Key Driver Analysis (up to 20 drivers)
- SHAP validation
- Quadrant charts
- Two segment comparisons

**"Segmentation Suite" Bundle:** $7,500 (save $1,000)
- Full segmentation (exploration + final)
- Segment profiling
- Scoring algorithm
- Segment cards

### Decoy Pricing

When presenting options, include a high-anchor option:

Example for MaxDiff:
- Aggregate analysis: $2,800
- HB individual-level: $5,500
- **HB + Simulator + Segments**: $8,500 ← Makes $5,500 look reasonable

### Rush Pricing

Rush fees serve two purposes: compensate for disruption AND encourage advance planning.

| Rush Level | Premium | Definition |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Priority | +25% | 24 hours faster than standard |
| Rush | +50% | Same-day or next-day |
| Emergency | +100% | Drop everything |

Most clients will avoid rush fees by planning ahead. Those who pay them really need it.

## Competitive Response Scenarios

### "Your competitor quoted lower"

**Response framework:**
1. Understand what's actually included in competitor quote
2. Highlight quality differentials (QA process, methodology documentation)
3. Offer to match if it's a strategic account, but only with commitment

**Script:**
"We're confident our pricing reflects the quality and turnaround we provide. If you share the competitive quote, I can show you specifically what's different in our deliverable. For ongoing partnerships, we do offer volume discounts that might close the gap."

### "We can do it in-house with SPSS/Q"

**Response framework:**
1. Acknowledge their capability
2. Focus on opportunity cost and turnaround
3. Position as capacity extension, not replacement

**Script:**
"Absolutely—if you have the software and analyst time, internal processing makes sense. Most of our clients use us for overflow, specialized methods their team doesn't run often, or simply to free their analysts for interpretation and client work instead of data processing."

### "Sawtooth is the industry standard for conjoint"

**Response framework:**
1. Agree (don't fight it)
2. Position on value, not equivalence
3. Be honest about limitations

**Script:**
"You're right—for complex conjoint designs with prohibitions, ACBC, or menu-based approaches, Sawtooth is the specialist. We focus on standard CBC executed reliably at a lower price point. For most product optimization and pricing studies, that's sufficient. For cutting-edge choice modeling, Sawtooth is worth the premium."

## Pricing Governance

### When to Discount

**Acceptable reasons:**
- Volume commitment (use standard tiers)
- Strategic account (document the rationale)
- Competitive situation with important client
- Bundle/package deals
- First project trial (one-time, limited)

**Not acceptable:**
- "They pushed back on price" (without competitive context)
- Small projects from large-potential clients (unproven potential isn't value)
- "We need the work" (undermines pricing integrity)

### Discount Approval Authority

| Discount Level | Approval Required |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Up to 10% | Analyst/Account Manager |
| 11-20% | Senior Manager |
| 21-30% | Director/Principal |
| 31%+ | Should not happen |

### Price Increase Protocol

Review pricing annually. When increasing:
- Give 60-day notice to retainer clients
- Grandfather existing quotes for 30 days
- Increase 5-10% maximum per year (unless costs change dramatically)
- Lead with value additions, not cost justification

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Finalize price list based on your actual costs
- [ ] Create quote template with standard terms
- [ ] Set up project tracking to monitor margins
- [ ] Brief anyone who will be quoting

### Short-term (Month 1)
- [ ] Develop 2-3 standard bundles
- [ ] Create one-page pricing summary for prospects
- [ ] Establish discount approval process
- [ ] Track win/loss by price point

### Ongoing
- [ ] Monthly margin review by service type
- [ ] Quarterly competitive pricing check
- [ ] Annual price list review
- [ ] Track time-to-complete for cost accuracy

## Financial Projections (Illustrative)

### Year 1 Conservative Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- Start with 2-3 anchor clients
- Average project size: $2,000
- 8 projects/month by month 6, 15 by month 12
- 65% average gross margin

| Month | Projects | Revenue | Gross Profit |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|

| 4-6 | 6/mo | $12,000/mo | $7,800/mo |
| 7-9 | 10/mo | $20,000/mo | $13,000/mo |
| 10-12 | 15/mo | $30,000/mo | $19,500/mo |
| **Year 1 Total** | ~100 | ~$180,000 | ~$117,000 |

### Year 1 Optimistic Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- Land 1-2 retainer clients early
- Win a tracking study contract
- Average project size: $2,500
- 20 projects/month by month 12

| Month | Projects | Revenue | Gross Profit |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1-3 | 5/mo | $12,500/mo | $8,125/mo |
| 4-6 | 10/mo | $25,000/mo | $16,250/mo |
| 7-9 | 15/mo | $37,500/mo | $24,375/mo |
| 10-12 | 20/mo | $50,000/mo | $32,500/mo |
| **Year 1 Total** | ~150 | ~$310,000 | ~$200,000 |

---

## Summary Recommendations

1. **Price 20-30% below mid-market agencies** — Competitive but not cheap
2. **Lead with crosstabs and tracking** — High margin, high volume, proves reliability
3. **Push bundles and retainers** — Increases average deal size and predictability
4. **Be honest about limitations** — Don't compete where you shouldn't; refer to specialists
5. **Protect margins aggressively** — Discounts require justification and approval
6. **Track everything** — You can't optimize what you don't measure

---

*This pricing strategy should be reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on actual project data, competitive dynamics, and capacity constraints.*
