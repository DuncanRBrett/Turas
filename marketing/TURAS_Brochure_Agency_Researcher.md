# Beyond Basic Tabs: Advanced Analytics for Agency Researchers

## You Know How to Run a Study. We Help You Deliver More Value.

You're conducting qual and quant research. Your clients are happy with the crosstabs and charts. But you know there's more in the data—insights that basic platforms can't extract.

**What if you could offer:**
- Driver analysis showing what truly impacts outcomes
- Conjoint analysis for product optimization
- Statistical segmentation beyond demographics
- Price sensitivity modeling
- Individual-level preference scores

**Without hiring a PhD statistician or learning R?**

**That's TURAS.**

---

## The Agency Challenge

You're caught between two worlds:

**What clients ask for:**
- "Run this survey and give us the top-line numbers"
- Quick turnaround
- Affordable pricing

**What would actually help them:**
- Strategic insights that drive decisions
- Rigorous analysis they can defend to stakeholders
- Advanced methods that justify research investment

**The problem:** You don't have time to become a statistician, and hiring one full-time doesn't make economic sense.

**TURAS bridges the gap.**
