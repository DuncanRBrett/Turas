## What is Pricing Research?

Pricing research helps you answer the critical question: **"What should we charge?"**

Unlike guessing or copying competitors, pricing research uses proven methodologies to understand how customers perceive value and make purchase decisions at different price points.

## What Can Pricing Research Tell You?

### Business Applications

| Industry | Use Case | Questions Answered |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **SaaS** | Subscription pricing | What price maximizes recurring revenue? |
| **E-commerce** | Product pricing | What's the sweet spot between volume and margin? |
| **CPG** | New product launch | What price range do consumers find acceptable? |
| **Services** | Service tiers | How should we price Good/Better/Best packages? |
| **B2B** | Enterprise pricing | How price-sensitive are different customer segments? |
| **Retail** | Promotional pricing | What discount level drives purchase without eroding margin? |

### Common Research Questions

- What price range is acceptable to our target market?
- What specific price maximizes revenue vs profit?
- How should we structure tiered pricing?
- How price-sensitive are different customer segments?
- Will raising prices hurt volume enough to reduce total revenue?
- What's our price elasticity of demand?

---

## How It Works

### Method 1: Van Westendorp PSM (Price Sensitivity Meter)

**What it does:** Identifies acceptable price ranges through four simple questions.

**The Questions:**
1. "At what price would this be too cheap (poor quality)?"
2. "At what price would this be a bargain?"
3. "At what price would this be getting expensive?"
4. "At what price would this be too expensive?"

**Output:** Four key price points
- **PMC** - Point of Marginal Cheapness (quality concern threshold)
- **OPP** - Optimal Price Point (minimal resistance)
- **IDP** - Indifference Price Point (neutral value perception)
- **PME** - Point of Marginal Expensiveness (too expensive threshold)

**Acceptable Range:** PMC to PME
**Optimal Range:** OPP to IDP

**Best For:**
- Exploring price perceptions for new products
- Understanding acceptable price ranges
- Strategic positioning decisions
- Early-stage pricing research

### Method 2: Gabor-Granger

**What it does:** Builds demand curve by measuring purchase intent at different prices.

**The Approach:**
- Show respondents 5-7 different price points
- Ask "Would you buy at $X?" for each price
- Construct demand curve from responses
- Find price that maximizes revenue (or profit)

**Output:**
- Demand curve (purchase intent vs price)
- Revenue curve (price × volume)
- Profit curve (if cost provided)
- Optimal price recommendations
- Price elasticity of demand

**Best For:**
- Finding specific optimal price
- Revenue/profit optimization
- Testing specific price alternatives
- Understanding price elasticity

### Method 3: NMS Extension (Newton-Miller-Smith)

**What it does:** Enhances Van Westendorp with behavioral calibration.

**Additional Questions:**
- "At your bargain price, how likely are you to purchase?"
- "At your expensive price, how likely are you to purchase?"

**Output:**
- Trial-optimal price (maximizes adoption)
- Revenue-optimal price (maximizes expected revenue)

**Best For:**
- More accurate revenue prediction
- Combining perceptual and behavioral data
- Validating Van Westendorp ranges
