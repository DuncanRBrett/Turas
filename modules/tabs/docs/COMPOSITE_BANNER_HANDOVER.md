# Composite banner — handover for a new session

**Status:** NOT STARTED. This is item #4 of the tabs‑v2 enhancement batch
(`project_tabs_v2_enhancement_batch` in memory). The other six items are done and
committed (`7ee36f34` feat, `092c3e44` template fix) on branch
`feature/tabs-executive-takeout`. This is the one we deliberately left for a fresh,
focused pass because it is the only item that can introduce a **silent statistical
error**.

**Model steer:** do this on Opus 4.8 (medium effort is fine). The risk is not
volume — it is a subtle correctness hole in significance testing that passes a
glance. Verify with the harnesses + suites, never by reasoning alone.

## What Duncan asked for

> "Allow me to create a composite banner – e.g. Total, Cape Town Campus, Marketing
> Department."

One banner whose **columns each come from a different variable**:

| Total | Cape Town Campus | Marketing Dept |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| (everyone) | Q02 = "Cape Town" | Q03 = "Marketing" |

This is unlike every banner today, where all columns are the mutually‑exclusive
options of **one** question (e.g. all the Campuses, or all the Departments).

---

## ⚠️ The trap — read this first

Significance letters are computed by `stats.sigLetters` (21_stats.js:385). For each
column it runs a **two‑proportion pooled z‑test** (`stats.propZ`, 21_stats.js:344)
against **every other non‑Total column**, and a Welch t‑test for means
(`stats.meanZ`). That test assumes the two groups are **independent / disjoint**
samples. That holds today because a respondent is in exactly one Campus (or one
Department, or one NET box).

In a composite banner the columns can **overlap**: a respondent can be *both* Cape
Town Campus *and* Marketing Department. Running the pairwise two‑proportion test
between overlapping columns is **statistically invalid** — it will still produce
letters, they will just be wrong. A weaker implementation will ship this and it
will look fine.

**Decision you must make explicitly (recommended default in bold):**

- **Suppress pairwise cross‑column significance letters for composite banners.**
  Show the values per column with no inter‑column letters. Honest and safe.
- *Optional, tasteful enhancement:* a "vs Total / vs the rest" indicator computed
  the way the Differences view already does it — `restPct` in 27d_diffs.js:36
  builds "everyone EXCEPT this column" (a genuinely disjoint complement) and tests
  the column against that with the same z‑test. That comparison **is** valid even
  for an overlapping column, because column vs (not‑column) is disjoint by
  construction. If you add per‑column sig, do it this way, not pairwise.
- Do **not** try to be clever and "only compare columns from the same source
  variable" unless Duncan asks — it complicates the UI and the common composite is
  one column per variable (nothing to compare within a variable anyway).

Whatever you choose, **state it in the UI** (a one‑line note under the banner:
"composite banner — significance is shown vs Total only / not shown between
columns") so the analyst is never misled.

---

## How banners flow today (pointers)

The pipeline is clean and the column abstraction makes adding heterogeneous
columns *easy*; the only hard part is the sig decision above.

1. **Banner id → columns.** `stats.columnsFor(banner)` (21_stats.js:117) returns
   `{ columns: [{label, letter, member: Uint8Array|null}], custom, ... }`.
   `member === null` is the Total column; otherwise `member[r] === 1` marks a
   respondent in that column. Two existing branches:
   - preset banner ("Q02"): one column per option, membership from
     `TR.MICRO.banner_vars` (21_stats.js:159).
   - custom banner ("custom:code:mode"): columns from one question's cats / NETs /
     boxes, membership via `memberArray` / `boxMemberArray` (21_stats.js:120‑157).
   **A composite just needs a third branch that builds one `member` array per
   column, each from a different question/value.** The `member`‑array abstraction
   already supports this perfectly — `memberArray(TR.MICRO.answers[code], n, [rowIndex])`.

2. **Columns → model.** `model.forQuestion(code, bannerId, filters, opts)`
   (22_model.js:415). `needCompute = custom || filtered` (line 421) routes through
   `computedModel`, which calls `columnsFor` (22_model.js:109), `tabulate`
   (line 111), and `sigLetters` (lines 61‑82 / 137 / `netRow` 144). **Composite
   must set `needCompute = true`** so it recomputes from microdata like a custom
   banner. Weighting is already handled — `tabulate` uses Kish n_eff.

3. **Model → render.** The table/chart just read `model.columns` + per‑cell
   `sig`; no renderer change needed beyond the sig suppression flowing through as
   empty strings. Each column carries its own `base` (different denominators per
   column is expected and already supported).

## Recommended design

### Data model — a composite is a *saved* entity
A composite banner is too rich for the `"custom:code:mode"` string id. It is also
inherently something you build deliberately and want to keep. Tie it to the
saved‑banner work just shipped:

- `28b_banners.js` (`TR.savedBanners`) already persists custom banners
  (localStorage + user‑state island + saved copies). Extend it (or add a parallel
  `TR.compositeBanners` store with the same shape) to hold composites:
  `{ id, name, columns: [ {code, mode, value/rowIndex|net|box, label}, ... ] }`
  where the first column is implicitly Total (or an explicit `{total:true}`).
- Banner id scheme: `"composite:<token>"`. `columnsFor` resolves the token to the
  stored spec and builds the columns. `bannerTabsHtml` (25_cards.js:355) renders
  saved composites as tabs alongside saved custom banners (reuse the
  `.btab.saved` styling; mark them e.g. with a different glyph).
- `state.banner` then holds `"composite:<token>"`. `model.forQuestion` /
  `pinBanner` (30_story.js:70) must treat composite like custom (can't recompute a
  pinned exhibit's live spec → resolve to firstBanner for pins, as custom does).

### `columnsFor` composite branch (the core)
```
if (banner.indexOf("composite:") === 0) {
  var spec = TR.compositeBanners.get(token);   // {columns:[...]}
  var cols = [{label:"Total", letter:"", member:null}];
  spec.columns.forEach(function (def, i) {
    var q = TR.d2.questionByCode(def.code);
    var answers = TR.MICRO.answers[def.code];
    var member = def.box != null
      ? boxMemberArray(TR.MICRO.boxes[def.code], n, def.box)
      : memberArray(answers, n, def.rows);     // def.rows = [rowIndex] or NET members
    cols.push({ label: def.label, letter: String.fromCharCode(65+i),
                member: member, composite: true });
  });
  return { columns: cols, composite: true };
}
```

### Significance
- In `computedModel` (22_model.js), when `spec.composite`, either skip the
  `sigLetters` calls (pass through `""`), or replace them with a vs‑Total/vs‑rest
  test per column (see the trap section; reuse the `restPct` idea from
  27d_diffs.js). Recommend: **suppress pairwise; ship vs‑Total only if time.**
- Make sure the `dual` (95+80) path and the `netRow` path (22_model.js:144) honour
  the same suppression — three call sites.

### UI — a small multi‑column builder
Extend the custom‑banner picker in 26_filter.js (`openPicker` /
`pickBannerMode` / `pickValues`). Flow: "+ Composite…" → pick a question → pick a
value/grouping → "add another column" (pick a *different* question + value) →
repeat → name it → save. It is naturally a saved entity (you just built it; you
don't want to lose it — same motivation as items #3/#9). Total is always column 0.

### Render / exports
Minimal. Confirm: per‑column base + low‑base ⚠ flags still work (they key off each
column's base — already per‑column); the "COMPUTED / recompute live" badge applies
(it is a microdata recompute, like custom); PNG/PPTX exports carry the columns
(they read `model.columns`). No change to `23_render.js`/`27_views.js` expected.

---

## Edge cases to get right
- **Overlapping columns** are fine for *display* (a respondent counts in both Cape
  Town and Marketing). They are NOT fine for pairwise sig — that's the whole trap.
- **Different bases per column** — expected; each column has its own denominator.
  Low‑base ⚠ is per‑column already.
- **Filters + composite** — an audience filter `mask` still applies; columns are
  intersected with the mask in `tabulate`. Make sure the composite branch passes
  the mask through (it does, via `tabulate(q, spec.columns, mask)`).
- **Total‑only reports (CCS)** — composites still work (Total + columns); don't
  dereference `banner_groups[0]` unguarded (see the `firstBanner()` guards already
  added for that crash class).
- **Pins / saved copies** — a pinned composite exhibit can't recompute a live spec;
  resolve `pinBanner()` to firstBanner like custom does (30_story.js:70), OR store
  the resolved column values in the pin. Composite spec must travel in the
  user‑state island if you want saved copies to keep it (extend `saveCopy`,
  32_report.js:217, like `banners` was added).

---

## Verification (do NOT skip)
Mirror what the rest of the batch did — node `vm` harnesses + the testthat suites.
Never headless‑run the real pipeline or touch OneDrive deliverables; **Duncan
regenerates via `launch_turas` himself** and eyeballs.

- Build a composite spec in a node harness, call `stats.columnsFor("composite:…")`,
  assert: heterogeneous `member` arrays correct (a known respondent is 1 in the
  right columns), Total is `null`, bases differ as expected.
- `model.forQuestion(code, "composite:…", [], {})` → values per column correct,
  and **sig letters are empty (or vs‑Total only) — never pairwise**. Plant an
  overlapping pair and assert no cross letters appear.
- Re‑run: `node modules/tabs/lib/html_report_v2/tests/takeout_tests.mjs` (27),
  `test_report_v2_bundler.R` (25), `test_html_report.R` (87), and a full‑bundle
  `vm` load (37+ modules) for syntax/load‑order.
- Load modules the way the harnesses in this batch did (see
  `tests/takeout_tests.mjs` for the `vm.createContext` pattern; the scratchpad
  harnesses were ephemeral).

## Files you'll touch (checklist)
- [ ] `21_stats.js` — `columnsFor` composite branch.
- [ ] `22_model.js` — route composite through `computedModel`; suppress/redirect
      sig at the three call sites (proportions, dual‑80, `netRow`).
- [ ] `28b_banners.js` (or a new `compositeBanners` store) — persist the spec.
- [ ] `25_cards.js` — `bannerTabsHtml` renders saved composite tabs + select.
- [ ] `26_filter.js` — the multi‑column composite builder UI.
- [ ] `30_story.js` / `32_report.js` — pin + saved‑copy handling for composites.
- [ ] CSS in `styles.css` if a new tab/builder style is needed.
- [ ] A one‑line UI note stating how composite significance is handled.

## Context you may want
- Memory: `project_tabs_v2_enhancement_batch` (the whole batch + what each item did),
  `project_executive_takeout` (the pattern tab), `feedback_tabs_v2_regen_via_launch_turas`
  (Duncan regenerates; don't run the pipeline).
- The saved‑banner store from this batch (`28b_banners.js`) and the live‑custom
  banner state (`state.customBanner`, 20_data.js / 25_cards.js / 26_filter.js) are
  the natural foundation to build composites on.
