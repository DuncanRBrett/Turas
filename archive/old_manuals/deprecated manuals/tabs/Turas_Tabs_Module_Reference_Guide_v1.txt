TURAS TABS MODULEReference Guide: Descriptive Analysis and Its Proper UsePurposeThis document is an authoritative reference for the Tabs module in the Turas analytics system. It explains when Tabs should be used, when they should not be used, how they work conceptually, and how outputs should be interpreted responsibly. It is not a user manual and does not describe operational steps.1. What the Tabs Module Exists to DoThe Tabs module supports descriptive understanding of survey data. It summarises response distributions and shows how those distributions vary across defined groups. Tabs answer the question: “What does the data look like?” They do not explain why outcomes occur, identify drivers, or establish causality.2. When Tabs Are the Right ToolTabs are appropriate when the objective is descriptive. For example, understanding overall satisfaction levels, comparing regions at a high level, profiling segments, or reviewing changes over time in a tracker. In these contexts, Tabs provide transparency and orientation rather than explanation.3. When Tabs Are the Wrong ToolTabs are misused when treated as explanatory. For example, concluding that a service attribute “drives” satisfaction based on a cross-tab is incorrect. Tabs do not control for other variables and cannot establish importance or causality.4. Preconditions for Using TabsBefore using Tabs, questions must be well-defined, grouping variables conceptually meaningful, sample sizes adequate for subgroup analysis, and analytical intent clearly descriptive.5. How Tabs Work ConceptuallyTabs partition data into subgroups and summarise responses within each subgroup. They do not adjust for confounding variables or overlapping influences. Any observed difference may reflect composition, measurement artefacts, or random variation.6. The Importance of BasesPercentages without bases are misleading. Small cells produce unstable results. Turas foregrounds base sizes and flags small cells to prevent over-interpretation.7. How Turas Approaches TabulationTuras requires explicit configuration and refuses ambiguous setups. This prevents silent errors and ensures reproducibility.8. Statistical FoundationsTabs rely on standard aggregation and descriptive statistics. Turas adds value through governance and consistency rather than novel mathematics.9. Interpreting Tabs ResponsiblyTabs should be treated as signals, not answers. Focus on broad patterns, avoid causal language, and use Tabs to inform further analysis.10. Relationship to Other MethodsTabs complement but do not replace modelling techniques. They are foundational, not definitive.11. Turas vs Other SoftwareThe distinction lies in assumption handling. Many tools infer defaults; Turas requires explicit decisions and refuses ambiguity. This suits high-stakes, repeatable research.12. How This Guide Should Be UsedConsult this guide when deciding whether Tabs are appropriate and how results may be interpreted. Procedural details belong in the user manual.Final PerspectiveTabs are foundational analysis. Used with discipline, they orient understanding. Used without discipline, they mislead. Turas Tabs exist to ensure descriptive analysis remains trustworthy.
